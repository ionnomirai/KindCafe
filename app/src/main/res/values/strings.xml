For me to talk to you\n
And I don\'t mean\n
To hurt your pride\n
But everybody needs a friend sometimes\n
To make you see the light\n\n

In the game of life\n
The strong survive\n
We\'re on a one-way street\n
We gotta make it out alive\n
And never let \'em drag us down\n
In the game of life\n
We live and die\n
Another breath begins\n
Another chance to win the fight\n
From the moment that you hit the ground\n
In the game of life\n\n

You\'re born to hunt\n
And never run away\n
And then you\'re hunted\n
By the prey\n
The wounded deer\n
Leaps highest to the sun\n
Until his day is done\n\n

In the game of life\n
The strong survive\n
We\'re on a one-way street\n
We gotta make it out alive\n
And never let \'em drag us down\n
In the game of life\n
We live and die\n
Another breath begins\n
Another chance to win the fight\n
From the moment that you hit the ground\n\n

Here comes the morning\n
It\'s time to play\n
The game of life\n
The game of life\n\n

In the game of life\n
The strong survive\n
We\'re on a one-way street\n
We gotta make it out alive\n
And never let \'em drag us down\n
In the game of life\n
We live and die\n
Another breath begins\n
Another chance to win the fight\n
From the moment that you hit the ground\n
It\'s the game of life\n
The game of life</string>
