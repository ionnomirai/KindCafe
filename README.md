# Kind Cafe
**Kind Cafe** – this is my graduation project (my thesis) for a bachelor's degree in Software Engineering.  

## Project description  
**Kind Cafe** – is an Android mobile application for a cafe. This application is not commercial. The application allows you to interact with the fictional cafe both online 
and without an internet connection (provided that, at least once after installation, the app has managed to download and cache data).  

The application was developed to make it easier for the user (client) to interact with the program. We also sought to maximize the customer's focus on their own thoughts 
when determining what to order as opposed to being distracted by an unfriendly interface while trying to figure out how to order in the program, etc. The interface of the 
program was developed in such a way that when working with it the client does not even notice that he works with the program and intuitively takes actions and was focused 
on what he came to the cafe for - i.e. on the selection and ordering of what he wants, for example:
* choice of dishes in a cafe;
* reduce the chance of error when placing an order;
* reduce the workload of service personnel;
* provide support to people with disabilities.

The last point is achieved due to the fact that using the application allows you to search and order dishes in a convenient place and without taking into account the time 
when choosing dishes (compared to ordering at the counter or with the help of a waiter). Afterwards, when interacting with the cafe staff, you only need to provide your 
account email and pay for the order.
